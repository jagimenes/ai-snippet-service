# AI Snippet Service

An AI-powered snippet manager built with **Node.js**, **Remix**, and **Gemini API**.  
You can create, view, and list summarized text snippets using AI.

## 🧠 Features

- ✍️ Create a new snippet by submitting text (summary generated by Gemini AI)
- 📋 List all snippets (sorted by newest first)
- 🔍 View snippet details by ID
- ⚠️ Error handling with toast notifications (e.g. not found, submission errors)
- 🔄 Form auto-reset after successful creation
- 🧪 Unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest
- 🐳 Docker-ready for frontend and backend
- 🌐 Environment-based API configuration (via `.env`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:3000/snippets](http://localhost:3000/snippets)

Make sure to configure `.env` files for both frontend and backend.

---

## .env for backend

```bash
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://mongo:27017/snippet-service" # or localhost if running locally
    MONGO_DB_NAME="snippet-service"
    GEMINI_URL="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    PORT=3000
```

## .env for frontend

```bash
    VITE_API_URL=http://backend:3000 # or localhost if running locally
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# inside backend/ folder
npm run test
```

---

## List of requests
GET /snippets
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/snippets
```

GET /snippets/:id
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:3000/snippets/{id}
```

POST /snippets
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3000/snippets \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"text": "What are microservices? Microservices are an architectural approach to software development in which an application is structured as a set of small, independent, and self-contained services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality of the system and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently."
}'
```

## Post-challenge reflection

Given additional time, I would focus on:

- Improved Error Handling: Implement a more robust error boundary strategy across the frontend, and add granular error responses in the backend for various failure scenarios (e.g., DB connectivity, AI service fallback).

- UI/UX Enhancements: Add loading skeletons, pagination, responsive design improvements, and accessibility features (ARIA tags, keyboard navigation, etc).

- Type Safety & Validation: Enforce stricter types and use schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod) for request and response structures, both server-side and client-side.

- API Security: Implement rate limiting, user authentication with JWT, and input sanitization to harden the backend.

- New features with AI: Maybe summarize images, or videos/audio messages (uploading files, AI processing using files, etc)

- CI/CD pipelines and deploy to AWS


Trade-offs

- Learned how to work with Gemini AI

- Learned how to create an entire AI enviroment very fast :)
